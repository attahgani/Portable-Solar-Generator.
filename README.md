# Portable Solar Generator

The Portable Mobile Solar Generator is a compact, plug-and-play renewable energy solution designed to provide reliable and clean energy for off-grid communities, mobile businesses, and remote applications.  

## Features
- Integrated **solar panel, battery, Pure Sine Wave Inverter, and charge controller** in one unit.  
- Portable and easy to set up.
- **Portable & Lightweight, Expandable PV Input
- Provides clean, renewable energy for households, businesses, and events.  
- Available in different capacities (500W ‚Äì 3kVA).


## Project Goals
- Empower communities with **sustainable energy access**.  
- Reduce dependence on fossil fuels.  
- Promote **green technology adoption** in Africa and beyond.  

## How It Works
1. The solar panels capture sunlight and convert it into DC energy to charge the built-in battery.  
2. The charge controller manages charging safely efficiently.  
3. The inverter converts the DC energy stored in the battery into AC for appliances.  
4. Users plug in their devices and enjoy clean power
5. Multiple output ports (AC, DC, USB) for power distribution to variousdevices simultaneously.

## Future Development
- IoT monitoring for performance tracking.  
- Larger capacity models (Pro Series: 3kVA‚Äì5kVA+).  
- Cost optimization for wider accessibility.
